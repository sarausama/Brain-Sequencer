## How it works
The user observes a pattern of the LED lights flashing and has to repeat it. The device displays instructions/score to the player using a user-friendly interface (LCD screen). It also outputs a unique sound for each LED which helps the user remember the pattern. The game also keeps track of the user's highest score. The pattern keeps getting longer as the player moves on to higher levels.
